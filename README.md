# Voyageur

### Description:
Travelers often struggle with organizing all their ideas and options when planning a trip, from restaurants and activities to detailed itineraries. The process becomes more complex with multiple destinations, budgeting concerns, and the need to coordinate with others. Voyageur is an all-in-one travel planner that allows users to store, categorize, and organize travel ideas (restaurants, museums, activities) and convert them into detailed, hour-by-hour itineraries. By leveraging Google Maps and LLM APIs, users can find places based on price, location, and preferences and even generate complete day-trip schedules. Multi-user collaboration enables users to invite friends or family to contribute and share trips.

### Target Audience:
- John, a 25 year-old who travels with a big group of friends and wants to have a way for them to collaborate easily on the travel itinerary.
- Lena, a 29-year-old food enthusiast who is keen on finding the best-rated restaurants in the cities she visits and would like to incorporate them into an itinerary to avoid sorting through a long list of saved spots in Google Maps.
- James, a 40-year-old business traveler looking to make the most of limited free time during work trips and needs a fast way to get a clear hour-by-hour schedule.

### Multi-user support
